# Zenbyte-OS

Zenbyte-OS is an experimental Linux distribution focused on simplicity, performance, and a clean modern system design.
Our goal is to build a Linux operating system that is lightweight, understandable, and fully under our control — from system layout to build pipeline.

Zenbyte-OS is still in early development and serves as a learning platform and long-term project to create a fast, maintainable, and well-structured Linux OS.
